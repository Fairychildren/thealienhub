     <p>The Owner's called Red Guy and is a purple haired being with tomato red skin. Where their from has a name that can't be spelled with any earthly letter but it's indeed one degree colder than the sun. Once a great land filled with plant life and music. It is now a shell of its former self and so unbareable that it has one person after its exodos.</p>
